IBM PC Disk Library
-------------------

Below is a list of disks available to the project's collection of [IBM PC Machines](/devices/pcx86/machine/).
For non-PC software, see [Disk Libraries](/disks/).

The focus here is on historically significant PC software from the early 1980s through the early 1990s, which
required nothing more than a machine equipped with an 8088 (or 80286 or 80386) CPU and a standard IBM video card.

Whenever possible, PCjs uses unmodified copies of the original software.  Exceptions include application
"Demo Disks" that we've created for our [IBM PC Application Demos](/apps/pcx86/) and copy-protected software that
requires a patch in order to run.  However, if patching is necessary, we try to identify and explain the patch
involved; see [Lotus 1-2-3 Release 1A*](/disks/pcx86/apps/lotus/123/1as/) for an example.

Any disk loaded into a PCjs machine can also be saved to your local machine, but be aware that any changes you
made to the disk will be saved as well, and if it's a DOS disk, PCjs may also update the disk's signature and BPB,
to help with disk identification and mounting; see the description of the
[PC DOS 0.90 Boot Sector](/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/0.90/#pc-dos-090-boot-sector) for an example.
[macOS](http://www.apple.com/macos/) has built-in support for mounting *.IMG* disk images, and Windows can mount
them with the help of third-party software like [OSFMount](http://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html).

The summary below is not a complete list of everything in our [Disk Manifests](#disk-manifests), just highlights.
For some of the disks, we have provided more information about the software, and in some cases, machines that
automatically run the software.  Eventually, everything in the library should be listed here, with links to pages
that describe the software in more detail, along with live demonstrations.

Disk Manifests
--------------

Typically, all the distribution disks for a single version of a piece of software are placed in a single
folder, along with a **manifest.xml** file containing metadata about the software and a list of the individual
disks.  This is generally referred to as a [Software Manifest](/apps/), but when dealing specifically with disk images,
it's also known as a Disk Manifest.  All Disk Manifests are then bundled into a [Disk Library](/disks/pcx86/library.xml).  

A Disk Manifest can then be added to a *[Floppy Drive Controller (FDC)](/docs/pcx86/fdc/)* configuration file,
making all its disks available to any machine loading that particular configuration file.

A simple FDC configuration file, such as [samples.xml](samples.xml), *could* contain individual &lt;disk&gt;
entries like:

```xml
<fdc id="fdcNEC">
    <disk path="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/1.00/PCDOS100.json">PC DOS 1.00</disk>
    <disk path="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/1.10/PCDOS110.json">PC DOS 1.10</disk>
    <disk path="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/PCDOS200-DISK1.json">PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 1)</disk>
    <disk path="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/PCDOS200-DISK2.json">PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 2)</disk>
    ...
</fdc>
```

However, listing individual diskettes like that is tedious, so support was added for Disk Manifest references:

Instead of listing the PC DOS 2.00 diskettes individually, they can now be added to an XML configuration file
with a single Disk Manifest reference:

```xml
<manifest ref="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/manifest.xml" disk="*"/>
```

When you want to include only one particular disk from a manifest, set the *disk* value to the *id* of the disk.
Here's how you would include only the *first* disk from PC DOS 2.00:

```xml
<manifest ref="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/manifest.xml" disk="disk01"/>
```

Here's what the entire Disk Manifest for PC DOS 2.00 currently looks like:

```xml
<manifest type="software">
    <title>PC DOS</title>
    <version>2.00</version>
    <type>DOS</type>
    <category>Operating System</category>
    <author>IBM/Microsoft</author>
    <releaseDate/>
    <disk id="disk01" size="184320" chs="40:1:9" img="archive/PCDOS200-DISK1.img" href="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/PCDOS200-DISK1.json" md5="d57ceef82122790d1c0ff7bebc12f90a" md5json="2507c02da6cbafe9a94a35cbdd993be2">
        <name>PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 1)</name>
    </disk>
    <disk id="disk02" size="184320" chs="40:1:9" img="archive/PCDOS200-DISK2.img" href="/disks/pcx86/dos/ibm/2.00/PCDOS200-DISK2.json" md5="1c7aac53c78446992f8821cf42d04c4a" md5json="b66e296319c1f97990b596b1aa376d39">
        <name>PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 2)</name>
    </disk>
</manifest>
```
