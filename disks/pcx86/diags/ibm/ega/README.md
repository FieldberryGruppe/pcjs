IBM EGA "FantasyLand" Demo
--------------------------

In the October 1986 issue of [PC Tech Journal](http://www.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/), John T. Cockerham wrote
the article "[Evaluating the EGA: The EGA Standard](http://www.pcjs.org/modules/shared/templates/pdf.html?url=/pubs/pc/magazines/pctj/PCTJ-1986-10/pages/PCTJ-1986-10%2053.pdf&page=53&total=228)",
which described IBM's "FantasyLand" demo:

> IBM wrote FantasyLand in 1984 in order to demonstrate some of the more obscure features of the EGA.
The program was distributed very selectively to dealers and sales representatives; it has never been a product
intended for sale.

> FantasyLand builds a large, 150-by-400-character virtual text screen in the EGA video RAM. The screen uses custom
fonts to create a map of an imaginary continent, complete with rivers, lakes, mountains, and fantastic creatures
like dragons and sea serpents. The illusion of bit-mapped graphics is great, but all the drawings actually are done
with custom characters from a 25-by-80 window into the larger virtual text screen. The program allows vertical and
horizontal smooth scrolling throughout the map by using the cursor keys, allowing the user to tour FantasyLand. Help
screens are implemented with the EGA's split-screen abilities and scroll smoothly up from the bottom of the screen when
requested.

> To make the test even more rigorous, FantasyLand uses the EGA's switchable fonts to create animation effects.
The program loads several copies of a custom font into memory, and an interrupt service routine cycles through the
copies every four system clock ticks. Certain characters in the custom font have slight differences across the copies
so that, when cycled, they give the illusion of motion--a dragon flaps his wings, smoke billows from a chimney, grass
waves in the wind. By tying the animation directly to the system's 8253 timer interrupt, font switching happens
continuously, independent of CPU speed and divorced from other program operations. Rapid ongoing font changes, along
with fast smooth scrolling in both directions, test subtle timing dependencies between subunits of the EGA.

Thanks to Eric, a friend of PCjs, we finally have a copy of the FantasyLand program, along with an assortment of other
EGA utilities that he kindly provided.  Sadly, FantasyLand doesn't yet work in the PCx86 emulator, but it's on our
"to-do" list.  Stay tuned!
