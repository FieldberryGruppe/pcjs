COMPAQ Diagnostics 5.08
-----------------------

This early COMPAQ Diagnostics diskette from the PCjs archives is noteworthy because it contains
[COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31](/disks/pcx86/dos/compaq/3.31/) system files that are more than *one year older*
than any other release of COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 we've seen.

From `README.CPQ`:

    The USER DIAGNOSTICS diskette contains the TEST program as
    well as SETUP.  USER DIAGNOSTICS Version 5.08 and SETUP version
    5.05 supercede any earlier versions located on other COMPAQ
    USER PROGRAMS diskettes.
