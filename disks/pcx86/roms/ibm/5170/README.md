### 5170V1 Notes (from PC DOS Retro)

    IBM PC AT BIOS dated 01/10/84 based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC AT Technical Reference dated March 1984.
    The BIOS was originally built using IBM MASM 1.0.
    
    Notes:
    - FILL.ASM was added to properly link the BIOS, this defines the area between the end of the main BIOS code and the ORGS data at E000.
    - IAPX286.MAC was derived based upon the generated code in the listings.
    - The code at FF5A in ORGS.ASM is hidden from the BIOS listings with .XLIST.
    - Using MASM 2.0, the code generated for line 1852 of TEST1.ASM will not match the original BIOS:
            CMP     WORD PTR ES:[DI],0FFFFH
      MASM 1 generates: 26 81 3D FF FF
      MASM 2 generates: 26 83 3D FF
    
    Additional files:
    FILL.ASM - see above
    ATLINK - linker response file
    EXE2BIN - DEBUG script to convert the EXE file to a BIN file
    
    Steps to build the PC AT BIOS:
    for %a in (*.asm) do masm %a;
    link @atlink
    debug < exe2bin

### 5170V2 Notes (from PC DOS Retro)

    IBM PC AT BIOS dated 06/10/85 based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC AT Technical Reference dated September 1985.
    The BIOS was originally built using IBM MASM 2.0.
    
    Notes:
    - FILL.ASM was added to properly link the BIOS, this defines the area between the end of the main BIOS code and the ORGS data at E000.
    - IAPX286.INC was derived based upon the generated code in the listings.
    - In TEST1.ASM there is an invalid POP instruction with no operands which MASM 2.0 assembles as PUSH 0.
    - The code at FF5A in ORGS.ASM is hidden from the BIOS listings with .XLIST.
    
    Additional files:
    FILL.ASM - see above
    ATLINK - linker response file
    EXE2BIN - DEBUG script to convert the EXE file to a BIN file

### 5170V3 Notes (from PC DOS Retro)

    IBM PC AT BIOS dated 11/15/85 based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC AT Technical Reference dated March 1986.
