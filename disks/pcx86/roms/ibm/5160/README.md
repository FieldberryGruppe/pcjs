### 5160V1 Notes (from PC DOS Retro) 

    IBM PC XT BIOS dated 11/08/82 is 5964 lines based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC XT Technical Reference dated April 1983.
    The BIOS was likely built using the Intel ASM86 Macro Assembler V2.0.
    
    This BIOS must be built with ASM86, several operand constructs are used which MASM does not recognize.
    
    Line 233:  CODE SEGMENT AT 0F000H
               to build with LINK remove the 'AT 0F000H'
               LINK will not generate code for 'AT address' segments
    Several lines in the listings are invalid:
    Line 937:  MOV WORD PRT(1CH*4),OFFSET BLINK_INT
    Line 3384: JMP WORD PRT CS:[SI+OFFSET M1]
    Line 4572: MOV ES:[DI+2000H ,AH]
    Line 5473: MOV DATA_AREA[OFFSET INTR_FLAG]
    
    LINK will generate an .EXE file with 1 relocation. This is due to a far jump to segment F000.
    Unfortunately EXE2BIN will not process the EXE file as it has more than 65278 bytes of code.
    
    The VECTOR segment data should be entered at FFF0 as follows:
    EA 5B E0 00 F0 31 31 2F 30 38 2F 38 32 FF FE 28

### 5160V2 Notes (from PC DOS Retro)

    IBM PC XT BIOS dated 01/10/86 based on the BIOS listings in the IBM PC XT Technical Reference dated March 1986.
    The BIOS was originally built using IBM MASM 2.0.
    
    Notes:
    - FILL.ASM was added to properly link the BIOS, this defines the area between the end of the main BIOS code and the ORGS data at E000.
    
    Additional files:
    FILL.ASM - see above
    XTLINK - linker response file
    EXE2BIN - DEBUG script to convert the EXE file to a BIN file
    
    Steps to build the PC XT BIOS:
    for %a in (*.asm) do masm %a;
    link @xtlink
    debug < exe2bin
