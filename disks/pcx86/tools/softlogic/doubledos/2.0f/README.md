DoubleDOS 2.0F
--------------

This version of DoubleDOS was archived by [@jeffpar](/disks/pcx86/personal/random/) and likely patched as well (e.g.,
to disable copy protection), since the date for `DOUBLEDO.EXE` is almost a year newer than the rest of the files.

It also seems to be very DOS version-sensitive.  It crashes on PC DOS 2.00 but appears to work OK on PC DOS 2.10, so
that's what we boot with here.  A directory listing of the 160Kb diskette is provided [below](#directory-of-doubledos-20f).
