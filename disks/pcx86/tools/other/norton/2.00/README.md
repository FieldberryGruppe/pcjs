Norton Utilities 2.00
---------------------

Norton Utilities 2.00 was distributed as two single-sided 160K disks on a single "flippy" diskette, which we have preserved
as two separate (side "A" and side "B") disk images.  Presumably this was done to ensure that the diskette would work on every
IBM PC, including the earliest machines that shipped only with single-sided drives.

Directory listings of [Side A](#directory-of-norton-utilities-201-side-a) and [Side B](#directory-of-norton-utilities-201-side-b)
are provided below.
