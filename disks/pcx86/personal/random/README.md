PCjs Random Disk Collection
---------------------------

Much like the [PCjs Random Document Collection](/docs/personal/random/), this is a random assortment of disk images
archived by [@jeffpar](http://jeffpar.com) that may or may not be of historical interest.

Some disks from this collection *have* been archived elsewhere, including:

* [COMPAQ Diagnostics 5.08](/disks/pcx86/diags/compaq/5.08/)
* [COMPAQ DeskPro 386 (1986)](/disks/pcx86/diags/compaq/utilities/1986/)
* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.10 (12-17-85)](/disks/pcx86/dos/compaq/3.10/#compaq-ms-dos-310-12-17-85)
* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 (1987)](/disks/pcx86/dos/compaq/3.31/#directory-of-compaq-ms-dos-331-1987)
* [DoubleDOS 2.0F](/disks/pcx86/tools/softlogic/doubledos/2.0f/)
* [Multitasking MS-DOS 4.00](/disks/pcx86/dos/microsoft/4.0M/)
* [Early OS/2 Prototypes](/disks/pcx86/os2/misc/) (eg, [CP-DOS](/disks/pcx86/os2/misc/cpdos/) and [FOOTBALL](/disks/pcx86/os2/misc/football/))

Any other disks you see [below](#directory-listings) are primarily ones that don't neatly fit into another PCjs category,
usually either because the disks contain a variety of unrelated files and/or unique content.

> NOTES: This was originally an MS-DOS 3.20 Distribution Disk (Disk 2 of 2) which I had subsequently modified for
personal use.  Presumably to make more room on the disk, I had moved off a few MS-DOS 3.20 files (BACKUP.EXE,
RESTORE.EXE, SHARE.EXE, TREE.EXE, and XCOPY.EXE), updated DEBUG.EXE, added MASM.EXE (v4.00), and then included
a few files of my own (eg, PCPAL.EXE and HDISK.ASM).  FYI, this particular copy of PCPAL.EXE was saved with **Alt-Esc**
configured as the activation key sequence. *--[@jeffpar](http://jeffpar.com)*
