Microsoft MS-DOS 2.00
---------------------

There was no MS-DOS 2.00 product *per se*.  Instead, there were OEM releases of MS-DOS based on version 2.00,
including:

* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 2.12](/disks/pcx86/dos/compaq/2.12/)

MS-DOS 2.00 Source Code
-----------------------

On March 25, 2014, the source code upon which OEMs based their MS-DOS 2.x releases was made available to the
public by the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/),
with the permission of Microsoft.

![MS-DOS 2.00]({{ site.pcjs-disks.baseurl }}/pcjs-disks/pcx86/dos/microsoft/2.00/MSDOS200-DISKS.jpg)

Unfortunately, the Computer History Museum chose not to divulge the original contents of the diskettes in its possession.
Instead, they released a ZIP archive that aggregated the contents of the diskettes into two folders, `v20object` and
`v20source`, with no clear indication which files came from which disk, why some files were renamed (and what the
original names were), and what (if anything) was omitted.

To underscore the confusion, some [WordStar 3.20](/disks/pcx86/apps/other/wordstar/3.20/) binary files were included in the
`v20source` folder, completely unrelated to MS-DOS and also completely useless, since the main executable, `WS.COM`, was *not*
included.
