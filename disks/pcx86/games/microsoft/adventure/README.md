Microsoft Adventure (1981)
--------------------------

UPDATE: There are now two "Microsoft Adventure" disk images in the PCjs Disk Library.  The latest one is called
"Microsoft Adventure (Unmodified)", which recreates the original copy-protected diskette.  See the PCjs blog post
"[Adventures in Copy Protection](/blog/2019/06/13/)" for more information.

A copy of the [Manual]({{ site.games-disks.baseurl }}/pcx86/microsoft/adventure/Adventure_Manual.pdf) is also available.

NOTE: You cannot use the PCjs "Save" feature to save a copy of a copy-protected diskette, because PCjs can save
only standard DOS-formatted disk images.

For more classic PC software experiences, see the PCjs collection of [IBM PC Application Demos](/apps/pcx86/).
