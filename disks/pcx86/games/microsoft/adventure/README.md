Microsoft Adventure (1981)
--------------------------

UPDATE: There are now two "Microsoft Adventure" disk images in the PCjs Disk Library.  The latest one is called
"Microsoft Adventure (Unmodified)", which replicates the original copy-protected diskette.

{% include machine.html id="ibm5150" %}

NOTE: You cannot use the PCjs "Save" feature to save a copy of a copy-protected diskette, because PCjs can save
only IMG disk images, which do not support copy protection.

For more classic PC software experiences, see the PCjs collection of [IBM PC Application Demos](/apps/pcx86/).
