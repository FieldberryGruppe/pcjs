Selected Magazine Articles on The Norton Utilities
--------------------------------------------------

### July 1983

In PC Magazine's July 1983 "Letters to PC", Peter Norton writes a "letter" that was more like a
free advertisement:

> **Save That File!**

> I read with interest Mark Zachmann’s “PC Tutor” column in PC, Volume 1 Number 11,and thought that I
> might be able to offer some more information on the subjects of erased files and hidden files.

> PC-DOS does not provide any easy or regular means either to recover hidden files or to control the file
> attributes, such as “hidden,” “system,” and “read-only.” However, there are programs available to do all
> these things. My Norton Utilities package includes tools that make this quite easy, and similar programs
> are also available from other authors.

> Many people do not understand how it could be possible to recover an erased file, but a little analogy
> can help make it clear. Erasing a file from a disk is similar to taking a file folder out of a filing
> cabinet, and throwing the pages from the folder into a waste basket. The data from the file hasn’t been
> destroyed, it simply has been discarded. Eventually the data on the disk will be completely lost, when
> other data is written onto the disk sectors where the old data was.

> An erased disk file can be recovered by a process that is analogous to digging through a waste basket,
> looking for something you threw away. Provided that the original data is still in the disk’s "waste basket,”
> it can be recovered. A program like UnErase, which is part of the Norton Utilities package, can do the
> tricky technical task of re-allocating data to an erased file. If the file recovery program is well-written,
> the process can be very easy.

> Anyone who uses an IBM PC would be wise to get a good set of file recovery programs, and not just to get
> back files that were accidentally erased. Good file recovery programs can help you get back data that was
> lost due to damage to a diskette, or due to scrambling of a disk’s file storage tables. Using your PC
> without file recovery programs is like driving a car without insurance, or swinging on a trapeze without
> a safety net.

### February 1986

PC Magazine's February 11, 1986 article "Norton Utilities: Stiii the Best?" by Winn L. Rosch had this
to say about Norton Utilities 3.10:

> For years. *The Norton Utilities* have been the standard choice for adding powers to DOS that its writers forgot.
> The latest update, Version 3.10, adds even more abilities.

> Now. less expensive products--PC Tools from Central Point and the File Recovery System from Brown Bag Software--offer
> similar enhancements and threaten Norton's dominance.

> The Norton Utilities are known primarily for their file recovery abilities.

> In Version 3.10, the intricate NU (main) program has been tamed somewhat by revising its default selections.
> Repeatedly pressing the Enter key is now enough to recover a file without a glance at the instructions. The 3.10
> package also includes a pair of worthy new features QU, or Quick Unerase, which can recover one file or a whole
> disk of them using a quick-and-easy query system, and a program to recover inadvertently removed subdirectories.

> Also included in *The Norton Utilities* are short programs that make everyday disk use more convenient, including
> a file- and disk-erase utility that now will overwrite specifications.

And the author summarized:

> Improved ease of use in Version 3.10, especially file recovery, Norton remains the class act in a now crowded
> field of DOS utilities.

### August 1987

PC Magazine's August 1987 article "Back From The Brink: File Recovery Software" by Winn L. Rosch had this
to say about Norton Utilities 4.0:

#### The Norton Utilities, Version 4.0 and The Norton Utilities Advanced Edition

> *The Norton Utilities* is the program that started it all: the first successful enhancements for DOS.
> The star attraction of the Peter Norton Computing package was (and remains) its miracle-working unerase
> utility. Since its introduction over 5 years ago, The Norton Utilities has gone through several
> revisions--Version 4.0 is now current--and has attracted a host of imitators along the way.

> With each new version, *The Norton Utilities* has improved, increasing in power, features, and ease of use.
> However, this latest release marks a change of direction, if not a bifurcation. Where there once was one
> package, now there are two: the ordinary *Norton Utilities* that sells for $100 and the *Advanced Edition*
> for $150. The Advanced Edition includes all of the features of Version 4.0 plus additional ones.

> The two packages remain the same up to a point. Both contain the identical set of utility programs which,
> for the first time, are linked by a menu-driven front-end, called the Norton Integrator. All of the *Norton*
> features are selectable using a moving bar. Better yet, as you select each program, the right side of the
> screen lists its various options so you hardly need to glance at the documentation.

> The program common to both versions of *The Norton Utilities* has an updated interface and a few mechanical
> aspects, but it remains functionally the same. Where function keys once reigned, control now rests in hot
> keys and moving bars. Despite this change, the default selections still lead you through manual file recovery.

> The common program also includes a byte-level editor, but the two *Norton* packages include different
> abilities. In the ordinary *Norton Utilities*, editing is limited to disk data areas. The advanced version
> expands the prey to include the whole disk from boot to last sector, including directories, the FAT, and
> disk partition table.

> All the other features of *The Norton Utilities* package are still available, from BEEP (which can now read
> files to play entire songs) to WipeDisk and WipeFile. Other subtle (and not-so-subtle) revisions and additions
> have also been made.

> The carry-over programs include Directory Sort, which writes its changes to disk; Disk Test, which now will
> move files that are in danger and mark or unmark bad sectors; File Attributes, which will mark or unmark files
> as hidden, system, or read-only; File Find, which locates files by name anywhere on a disk; File Size, which
> lists the actual disk space used by the data in a file as well as the di.sk space it requires; Li.st Directories;
> Line Print; Screen Attributes. which changes screen colors; System Information, which now includes a microprocessor
> speed test, a disk speed test, and a combined test; Time Mark; Text Search; and UnRemove Directory, which is pretty
> much self-explanatory.

> Added to the previous endowment is ASK. which grabs typed text to help you make your batch files interactive,
> and Norton's Change Directory (NCD), that takes you to any subdirectory anywhere on a disk almost instantly;
> you merely type part of its name. For instance. NCD GARB will take you to the subdirectory named GARBAGE six
> levels down from anywhere on the disk. File Info allows you to append a 65-character description to each directory
> entry to help you remember what’s what and where.

> In addition to the functions of *The Norton Utilities*, Version 4.0, the *Advanced* package includes Speed Disk,
> which packs disk clusters and makes files contiguous, and an unformat feature. As with other unformat utilities,
> this one requires you to run a special program when you boot up and also during your daily routine. The unformat
> process restores the system to the place it was when last saved.

> The documentation, which includes two manuals, is the best of any package evaluated here. One describes the
> utilities and their functions. The other tells you more than you might ever need to know about how DOS works.
> All in all, *The Norton Utilities* is still the most feature-packed, most polished DOS enhancement available.

And *The Norton Utilties, Version 4.0* shared PC Magazine's "Editor's Choice" award with *PC Tools* and SafetyNet*:

> The venerable *Norton Utilities* still earns a tip of our hat, too. The package provides the most functions--all
> of them so useful you’ll wonder how you did without them--and it gives you the best documentation and the slickest
> presentation. Rather than buying the *Advanced Edition* at its $50 premium, however, we'd join *The Norton Utilities*,
> Version 4.0, with *PC Tools* (at $39.95) instead. You'll pay less, get all the added abilities of the *Advanced Edition*,
> and have its resident mode as a bonus.
