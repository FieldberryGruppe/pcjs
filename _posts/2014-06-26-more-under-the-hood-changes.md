v1.13.7 of PCjs contains a few minor improvements, mostly in terms of rendering video modes a little more
efficiently.  The rest of the changes to the website involved beefing up support for both "software manifests"
and "document manifests."

To that end, there's a new [/pubs/](/pubs/) directory for old documents, and [/disks/pcx86/](/disks/pcx86/) contains
more disk images, with more on the way.  I have a TON of old diskette images, and it has taken more time to organize
them and create manifests than I would like.
