Thanks to a friend and former co-worker, I was able to add a small collection of early Xenix distributions to the PCjs
archives recently:

- [IBM PC XENIX 1.0](/disks/pcx86/unix/ibm/xenix/1.0/)
- [IBM PC XENIX 2.0](/disks/pcx86/unix/ibm/xenix/2.0/)
- [SCO Xenix 286 v2.2.1e](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/286/2.2.1e/)
- [SCO Xenix 286 v2.2.3b](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/286/2.2.3b/)
- [SCO Xenix 286 v2.3.2d](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/286/2.3.2d/)
- [SCO Xenix 386 v2.2.3b](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/386/2.2.3b/)
- [SCO Xenix 386 v2.3.2f](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/386/2.3.2f/)
- [SCO Xenix 386 v2.3.4h](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/386/2.3.4h/)

Notably, [SCO Xenix 386 v2.2.3b](/disks/pcx86/unix/sco/xenix/386/2.2.3b/) is an original copy of what may be the oldest
surviving 386-based PC operating system.

Previously, that honor went to (a reconstructed copy of) SCO Xenix 386 v2.2.3c, as explained in this series of
[OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/) posts:

- [The XENIX 386 2.2.3 Mystery (January 3, 2013)](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-xenix-386-2-2-3-mystery/)
- [The XENIX 2.2.3 Mystery, Continued (January 18, 2013)](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-xenix-2-2-3-mystery-continued/)
- [Oldest Surviving 386 PC OS? (March 9, 2017)](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/oldest-surviving-386-pc-os/)
- [What a Coincidence (March 11, 2017)](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/what-a-coincidence/)
- [Tales From the Xenix Crypt (March 13, 2017)](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/tales-from-the-xenix-crypt/)

Also see this series of [SoylentNews](https://soylentnews.org/) posts:

- [Restoring Xenix 386 2.2.3c (Part 1)](https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=17/03/03/1620222)
- [Xenix 2.2.3c Restoration: No Tools, No Problem (Part 2)](https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=17/03/07/1632251)
- [Xenix 2.2.3c Restoration: Damage Mapping (Part 3)](https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=17/03/11/2014253)
- [Xenix 2.2.3c Restoration: Xrossing The X (Part 4)](https://soylentnews.org/article.pl?sid=17/03/13/086250)

There were *older* releases of SCO Xenix 386 (2.2.1 and 2.2.2), and there may also be older non-SCO releases out there,
but until they surface, this is all we have.
