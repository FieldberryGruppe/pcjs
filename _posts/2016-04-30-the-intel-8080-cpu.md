Or rather, introducing [PC8080](/modules/pc8080/), a new 8080-based machine emulator recently added to the
PCjs Project.

Our first [8080 Test Machine](/devices/pc8080/machine/exerciser/) loads a copy of the
[8080 Exerciser](https://web.archive.org/web/20151006085348/http://www.idb.me.uk/sunhillow/8080.html)
(specifically, [8080EX1](/devices/pc8080/ram/exerciser/8080EX1.MAC)) and intercepts the exerciser's CP/M console
calls so that you can see its progress in the Control Panel window.  It's a "headless" test machine
(no keyboard or display), so that's all you get.

The good news: PC8080 passes all the 8080 Exerciser tests.  And it doesn't do it by using all sorts of weird
"flags tables" that most other 8080 emulators seem to fall back on.

Like all the other CPU emulations in the PCjs Project, PC8080 never "calculates" the flags unless/until they are
actually required, which considerably speeds up arithmetic operations.

Of particular note are the 8080's subtract, compare, and decrement operations, which actually perform addition,
not subtraction, by using two's complement arithmetic in "stages": the first stage (inverting the source operand)
occurs *before* the addition, and the second stage (incrementing the inverted operand) occurs *after* the addition.
And it appears to be the result of the *first* stage, not the second, that determines the state of the Auxiliary
Carry flag (AF).

The behavior of the Auxiliary Carry flag (AF) and the associated DAA instruction are probably the most significant
(and least understood) *arithmetic* differences between the 8080 and all later x86-based CPUs.  Well, there's also
the fact that the 8080 doesn't provide an Overflow flag (OF).  Internally however, PC8080 retains the ability to
calculate overflow (since PC8080 was a fork of PCjs), which should be useful when we add Z80 support to PC8080.

On a related note, [Ken Shirriff](http://www.righto.com/) has some fascinating blog posts on the 8085 that also
provide clues as to how the 8080 likely operates:

The idea is to make [PC8080](/modules/pc8080/) sufficiently configurable so that it will work with a variety of
8080-based systems, including those with memory-mapped video displays (like
[Space Invaders](/devices/pc8080/machine/invaders/)), as well as simpler terminal-based systems, like the CP/M-based
systems of old.

In fact, as soon as [Space Invaders](/devices/pc8080/machine/invaders/) is working, my next planned adaptation
is a DEC VT100 terminal emulator (itself an 8080-based machine) which can then be "wired up" to other PCjs machine
simulations.  This will not be yet-another VT100-compatible emulation -- which, like 8080 emulators, has been done to
death -- but rather a simulation of the original VT100 hardware, building on [Adam Mayer's](https://github.com/phooky)
work [reverse-engineering the VT100](https://github.com/phooky/VT100-Hax).
