PCjs Personal Document Collection
---------------------------------

Much like the [PCjs Personal Disk Collection](/disks/pcx86/personal/), this is an assortment of old
documents archived by [@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com) that may or may not be of historical interest.

We're kicking off this new section of the site with a couple of documents created by [@jeffpar](https://jeffpar.com)
in 1984, detailing his early adventures in PC debugging: disassembling and disabling
[dBASE III Copy-Protection](#dbase-iii-copy-protection).

### dBASE III Copy-Protection

* [dBASE III Debugging Notes](/pubs/docs/personal/1984-09-16--DBASE_III_DEBUG.pdf)
* [dBASE III Patching Procedure](/pubs/docs/personal/1984-09-25--DBASE_III_PATCH.pdf)

NOTE: Copies of the [dBASE III](/disks/pcx86/apps/other/dbase3/1.0/) disks can be found in our [IBM PC Disk Library](/disks/pcx86/).
