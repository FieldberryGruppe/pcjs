COMPAQ Reference Manuals
------------------------

COMPAQ reference material is much harder to find than IBM's.  Perhaps that's because COMPAQ didn't publish as much
as IBM.  Whatever the reason, this is a woefully underpopulated section of the website.

The one bright spot is a copy of the [COMPAQ DeskPro 386/25 Technical Reference Guide (Volume I)](deskpro386/) that I
found on **ebay** some years ago.  Sadly, Volume II is still nowhere to be found.
