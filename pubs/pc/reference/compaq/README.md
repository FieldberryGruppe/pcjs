COMPAQ Reference Manuals
------------------------

COMPAQ reference material is much harder to find than IBM's.  Perhaps that's because COMPAQ didn't publish as much
as IBM, or perhaps their manuals were too expensive, or maybe people simply weren't that interested.  After all, the
fact that COMPAQ computers were *so* compatible with IBM's meant that most programmers really only needed the
original IBM technical reference manuals.

Whatever the reason, this is a depressingly underpopulated section of the website.  However, I've been trying to remedy
that, by picking up any old, unique COMPAQ manuals whenever I spot them online.

For example, I located a copy of the [COMPAQ DeskPro 386/25 Technical Reference Guide (Volume I)](deskpro386/)
a few years ago.  I still haven't found Volume II, but table of contents in Volume I tells us what the second volume
contained:

- Chapter 5 KEYBOARD
- Chapter 6 POWER SUPPLY
- Chapter 7 MULTIPURPOSE FIXED DISK DRIVE CONTROLLER BOARDS
- Chapter 8 DISKETTE DRIVES
- Chapter 9 FIXED DISK DRIVE SYSTEMS
- Chapter 10 FIXED DISK DRIVE BACKUP SYSTEMS
- Chapter 11 VIDEO DISPLAY CONTROLLER BOARDS
- Chapter 12 MONITORS
- Chapter 13 ASYNCHRONOUS COMMUNICATIONS/PARALLEL PRINTER BOARD
- Chapter 14 COMPAQ 300-/600-MEGABYTE FIXED DISK DRIVE EXPANSION UNIT
- Appendix A INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARDS
- Appendix B ERROR MESSAGES 

In 2019, I obtained a copy of the [COMPAQ 80286-Based Products Technical Reference Guide (Volume II)](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArcO_mFRe1Z9gq463rsLHiJe9AY7FQ),
which contains the following chapters:

- CHAPTER 7 VIDEO DISPLAY CONTROLLER BOARDS
- CHAPTER 8 KEYBOARDS
- CHAPTER 9 POWER SUPPLY
- CHAPTER 10 DISKETTE DRIVES
- CHAPTER 11 FIXED DISK DRIVES
- CHAPTER 12 FIXED DISK DRIVE BACKUP SYSTEMS
- CHAPTER 13 MONITORS
- CHAPTER 14 BIOS PROGRAMMING GUIDE

As you can see, the older 80286 Volume II has significant overlap with the newer 80386 Volume II, but obviously it's
hard to be completely satisified with this mis-matched pair of volumes.  Hopefully I or someone else will eventually
locate both Volume I for the 80286 *and* Volume II for the 80386, and we'll finally have matching sets.

I also want to thank the [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/) for the following:
