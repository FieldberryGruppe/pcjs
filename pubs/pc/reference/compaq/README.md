COMPAQ Reference Manuals
------------------------

COMPAQ reference material is much harder to find than IBM's.  Perhaps that's because COMPAQ didn't publish as much
as IBM, or perhaps their manuals were too expensive, or maybe people simply weren't that interested.  After all, the
fact that COMPAQ computers were *so* compatible with IBM's meant that most programmers really only needed the
original IBM technical reference manuals.

Whatever the reason, this is a depressingly underpopulated section of the website.  However, I've been trying to remedy
that, by picking up any old COMPAQ manuals whenever I spot them online.  Here's what I obtained so far:

- [COMPAQ 80286-Based Products Technical Reference Guide](80286/)
- [COMPAQ DeskPro 386/25 Technical Reference Guide (Volume I only)](deskpro386/)

I also want to thank the [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/) for the following:

* [COMPAQ Technical Reference Guide (1995)](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ArcO_mFRe1Z9gt4UVUaaBnhX_UhPjg?e=UJJpRB)
