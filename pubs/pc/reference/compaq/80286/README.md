COMPAQ 80286-Based Products Reference Manuals
---------------------------------------------

In early 2019, I found a copy of Volume I of the **COMPAQ 80286-Based Products Technical Reference Guide**, but Volume II
was missing.  Fortunately, fellow COMPAQ enthusiast Ray Knights contacted me and generously offered his complete two-volume
set, which I've preserved below.  Ray's volumes were in excellent condition, in their original box.  They are 4th editions,
updated December 1987, whereas the lone volume found earlier this year is a 3rd edition, updated May 1987.
