        *
        * I used to initialize every word to 0x3ff, as if the NVR had been freshly erased, but that causes the
        * firmware to (attempt to) beep and then display an error code (2).  As the DEC Technical Manual says:
        *
        *      If the NVR fails, the bell sounds several times to inform the operator, and then default settings
        *      stored in the ROM allow the terminal to work.
        *
        * but I think what they meant to say is that default settings are stored in the RAM copy of NVR.  So then
        * I went into SET-UP, pressed SHIFT-S to save those settings back to NVR, and then used the PC8080 debugger
        * "d nvr" command to dump the NVR contents.  The results are below.
        *
        * The first dump actually contains only two modifications to the factory defaults: enabling ONLINE instead
        * of LOCAL operation, and turning ANSI support ON.  The second dump is unmodified (the TRUE factory defaults).
        *
        * By making selective changes, you can discern where the bits for certain features are stored.  For example,
        * smooth-scrolling is apparently controlled by bit 7 of the word at offset 0x2B (and is ON by default in
        * the factory settings).  And it's likely that the word at offset 0x32 (ie, the last word that's not zero)
        * is the NVR checksum.
        *
        * The TRUE factory defaults are here for reference:

 * DC011 is referred to as a Timing Chip.
 *
 * As p. 4-55 (105) of the VT100 Technical Manual (July 1982) explains:
 *
 *      The DCO11 is a custom designed bipolar circuit that provides most of the timing signals required by the
 *      video processor. Internal counters divide the output of a 24.0734 MHz oscillator (located elsewhere on the
 *      terminal controller module) into the lower frequencies that define dot, character, scan, and frame timing.
 *      The counters are programmable through various input pins to control the number of characters per line,
 *      the frequency at which the screen is refreshed, and whether the display is interlaced or noninterlaced.
 *      These parameters can be controlled through SET-UP mode or by the host.
 *
 *          Table 4-6-1: Video Mode Selection (Write Address 0xC2)
 *
 *          D5  D4      Configuration
 *          --  --      -------------
 *          0   0       80-column mode, interlaced
 *          0   1       132-column mode, interlaced
 *          1   0       60Hz, non-interlaced
 *          1   1       50Hz, non-interlaced
 *
 * On p. 4-56, the DC011 Block Diagram shows 8 outputs labeled LBA0 through LBA7.  From p. 4-61:
 *
 *      Several of the LBAs are used as general purpose clocks in the VT100. LBA3 and LBA4 are used to generate
 *      timing for the keyboard. These signals satisfy the keyboard's requirement of two square-waves, one twice the
 *      frequency of the other, even though every 16th transition is delayed (the second stage of the horizontal
 *      counter divides by 17, not 16). LBA7 is used by the nonvolatile RAM.
 *
 * And on p. 4-62, timings are provided for the LBA0 through LBA7; in particular:
 *
 *      LBA6:   16.82353us (when LBA6 is low, for a period of 33.64706us)
 *      LBA7:   31.77778us (when LBA7 is high, for a period of 63.55556us)
 *
 * If we assume that the CPU cycle count increments once every 361.69ns, it will increment roughly 88 times every
 * time LBA7 toggles.  So we can divide the CPU cycle count by 88 and set LBA to the low bit of that truncated
 * result.  An even faster (but less accurate) solution would be to mask bit 6 of the CPU cycle count, which will
 * doesn't change until the count has been incremented 64 times.  See getLBA() for the chosen implementation.

 *
 * As p. 4-67 (117) of the VT100 Technical Manual (July 1982) explains:
 *
 *      The DCO12 performs three main functions.
 *
 *       1. Scan count generation. This involves two counters, a multiplexer to switch between the counters,
 *          double-height logic, scroll and line attribute latches, and various logic controlling switching between
 *          the two counters. This is the biggest part of the chip. It includes all scrolling, double-height logic,
 *          and feeds into the underline and hold request circuits.
 *
 *       2. Generation of HOLD REQUEST. This uses information from the scan counters and the scrolling logic to
 *          decide when to generate HOLD REQUEST.
 *
 *       3. Video modifications: dot stretching, blanking, addition of attributes to video outputs, and multiple
 *          intensity levels.
 *
 *      The input decoder accepts a 4-bit command from the microprocessor when VID WR 2 L is asserted. Table 4-6-2
 *      lists the commands.
