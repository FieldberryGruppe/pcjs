     *      A bit (CLICK) in the keyboard status word controls the bell....  When a single status word contains
     *      the bell bit, flip-flop E3 toggles and turns on E1, generating a click. If the bell bit is set for
     *      many words in succession, the UART latch holds the data output constant..., allowing the circuit to
     *      produce an 800 hertz tone. Bell is generated by setting the bell bit for 0.25 seconds.  Each cycle of
     *      the tone is at a reduced amplitude compared with the single keyclick....  The overall effect of the
     *      tone burst on the ear is that of a beep.
