     * The Monitor component can be configured with the following config properties:
     *
     *      monitorWidth: width of the monitor canvas, in pixels
     *      monitorHeight: height of the monitor canvas, in pixels
     *      monitorColor: background color of the monitor canvas (default is black)
     *      monitorRotate: the amount of counter-clockwise monitor rotation required (eg, -90 or 270)
     *      aspectRatio (eg, 1.33)
     *
     * NOTE: I originally wanted to call this the Screen class, but alas, the browser world has co-opted that
     * name, so I had to settle for Monitor instead (I had also considered Display, but that seemed too generic).
     *
     * Monitor is probably a better choice anyway, because that allows us to clearly differentiate between the
     * "host display" (which the browser may refer to as page, document, window, or screen, depending on context)
     * and the "guest display", which we now try to consistently refer to as the Monitor.
     *
     * There are still terms of art that can muddy the waters; for example, many video devices support the concept
     * of "off-screen memory", and sure, we could call that "off-monitor memory", but let's not get carried away.
